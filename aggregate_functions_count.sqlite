-- Aggregate Functions
-- Count

-- The fastest way to calculate how many rows are in a table is to use the COUNT() function.

-- COUNT() is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and counts the number of non-empty values in that column.

-- SELECT COUNT(*)
-- FROM table_name;

-- Here, we want to count every row, so we pass * as an argument inside the parenthesis.

-- Letâ€™s count how many apps are in the table.

-- In the code editor, run:

-- SELECT COUNT(*)

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM fake_apps
WHERE price = 0;
