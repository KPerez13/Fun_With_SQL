Aggregate Functions
Introduction

SQL Queries don’t just access raw data, they can also perform calculations on the raw data to answer specific data questions.

Calculations performed on multiple rows of a table are called aggregates.

In this lesson, we have given you a table named fake_apps which is made up of fake mobile applications data.

Here is a quick preview of some important aggregates that we will cover in the next five exercises:

    COUNT(): count the number of rows
    SUM(): the sum of the values in a column
    MAX()/MIN(): the largest/smallest value
    AVG(): the average of the values in a column
    ROUND(): round the values in the column

Let’s get started!

Before getting started, take a look at the data in the fake_apps table.

In the code editor, type the following:

SELECT *
FROM fake_apps;

What are the column names?
*/ 

SELECT * 
FROM fake_apps; 

-- column 1 == id 
-- column 2 == name 
-- column 3 == category 
-- column 4 == downloads
-- column 5 == price
