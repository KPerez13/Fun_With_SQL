-- Aggregate Functions
-- Group By I

-- Oftentimes, we will want to calculate an aggregate for data with certain characteristics.

-- For instance, we might want to know the mean IMDb ratings for all movies each year. We could calculate each number by a series of queries with different WHERE statements, like so:

-- SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
-- FROM movies
-- WHERE year = 1999;

-- SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
-- FROM movies
-- WHERE year = 2000;

-- SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
-- FROM movies
-- WHERE year = 2001;

-- and so on.

-- Luckily, there’s a better way!

-- We can use GROUP BY to do this in a single step:

-- SELECT year,
--    AVG(imdb_rating)
-- FROM movies
-- GROUP BY year
-- ORDER BY year;

-- GROUP BY is a clause in SQL that is used with aggregate functions. It is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to arrange identical data into groups.

-- The GROUP BY statement comes after any WHERE statements, but before ORDER BY or LIMIT.
-- Task 1
SELECT price, COUNT(*)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY price; 

-- Task 2:
-- In the previous query, add a WHERE clause to count the total number of apps that have been downloaded more than 20,000 
-- times, at each price.

SELECT price, COUNT(*)
FROM fake_apps 
WHERE downloads > 20000
GROUP BY price; 

-- Task 3:
-- Remove the previous query.

-- Write a new query that calculates the total number of downloads for each category.

-- Select category and SUM(downloads).

SELECT category, SUM(downloads)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY category;
