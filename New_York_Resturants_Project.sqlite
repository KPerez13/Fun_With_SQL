/*
We have put together a table of restaurants called nomnom and we need your help to answer some questions. Use the SQL commands you just learned and find the best dinner spots in the city.

The schema of this table is available here.

Let’s begin!

Write the following queries:

1.

Start by getting a feel for the nomnom table:

SELECT *
FROM nomnom;

What are the column names?
2.

What are the distinct neighborhoods?
3.

What are the distinct cuisine types?
4.

Suppose we would like some Chinese takeout.

What are our options?
5.

Return all the restaurants with reviews of 4 and above.
6.

Suppose Abbi and Ilana want to have a fancy dinner date.

Return all the restaurants that are Italian and $$$.
7.

Your coworker Trey can’t remember the exact name of a restaurant he went to but he knows it contains the word ‘meatball’ in it.

Can you find it for him using a query?
8.

Let’s order delivery to the house!

Find all the close by spots in Midtown, Downtown or Chinatown.

(OR can be used more than once)
9.

Find all the health grade pending restaurants (empty values).
10.

Create a Top 10 Restaurants Ranking based on reviews.
11.

Use a CASE statement to change the rating system to:

    review > 4.5 is Extraordinary
    review > 4 is Excellent
    review > 3 is Good
    review > 2 is Fair
    Everything else is Poor

Don’t forget to rename the new column!
